  "summary": "Diff adds a new ResultBreakdownPieChart component and updates SIP/Lump Sum/PPF calculator pages to import/use it instead of the bar chart. However, key REQ-1 acceptance criteria (legend with INR-formatted values and label-override behavior) are not verifiably implemented from the truncated diff content.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Component includes a legend that shows the label + exact INR-formatted value for each slice and uses the same label override behavior as the current bar chart component.",
      "reason": "The new component defines label override props and imports formatINR, but the provided diff content is truncated before any legend rendering is shown. Therefore, the legend behavior (including INR formatting and label overrides) cannot be confirmed from the evidence.",
