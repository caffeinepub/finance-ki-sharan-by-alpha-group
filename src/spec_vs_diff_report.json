  "summary": "Most performance-focused requirements appear addressed: non-home pages are converted to React.lazy imports in App.tsx, a shared RouteLoadingFallback component was added, the chat widget is deferred via an AsyncChatAssistantWidget wrapper, the HomePage hero image now has explicit dimensions/aspect ratio and async decoding, and React Query defaults plus maintenance/admin query caching were tuned. However, the diff also includes several unrelated UI/content/admin enhancements not requested by the performance brief.",
