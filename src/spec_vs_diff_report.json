  "summary": "A reusable CashFlowSection component with CSV export and an empty-state message was added, along with CSV/schedule utilities. However, only the SIP and Lump Sum calculator pages were updated to include the Cash Flow section; the diff does not show updates to the rest of the required calculator pages (including XIRR-specific syncing).",

      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Update every existing calculator page to include the Cash Flow section and populate it with an appropriate cash-flow schedule derived from the calculator’s current inputs and assumptions (including XIRR reflecting the user-edited cash flows).",
      "reason": "The diff shows CashFlowSection integrated only in SIPCalculatorPage and LumpSumCalculatorPage. There is no evidence that the other listed calculator pages/routes (Step-Up, SWP, SSY, PPF, EPF, FD, RD, EMI, Home Loan EMI, Fixed vs Reducing Loan, GST, HRA, NPS, APY, Gratuity, XIRR, CAGR, Simple Interest, Simple vs Compound Interest, NSC) were updated to display a Cash Flow section or generate schedules appropriate to their inputs. No XIRR page changes are shown to ensure the cash-flow list mirrors user edits.",
