  "summary": "Finance Ki Sharan (By Alpha Group) is a React + TypeScript single-page financial education platform backed by a Motoko canister on the Internet Computer. The site provides structured learning sections, a searchable glossary with cross-references, categorized articles, research paper downloads (via ExternalBlob), investor-protection/regulations awareness content, a public blogs section (list + detail) backed by backend blog APIs, a contact/feedback flow with an admin-only feedback viewer, and a NIFTY 50 ticker shown in the global footer. Authentication uses DFINITY Internet Identity; backend operations are guarded by role-based access control (admin/user/guest) and an optional maintenance mode that blocks non-admin users. A floating in-app chat widget (“ArthSaathi”) provides deterministic, education-only responses sourced from site content with strict refusal for personalized investment recommendations and legal/tax advice.",

    "Frontend is a SPA built with TanStack Router (file-defined routes) and TanStack React Query for all canister calls (queries + mutations).",
    "UI layer uses TailwindCSS with shadcn-style component primitives; theming is driven by CSS variables (OKLCH tokens) and next-themes for dark/light mode.",
    "Internet Identity auth is encapsulated in an InternetIdentityProvider (AuthClient) with persisted identity restore and login/logout state flags.",
    "Backend canister access is encapsulated via a useActor hook that creates anonymous/authenticated actors and initializes access control using a secret from the URL hash/sessionStorage.",
    "Motoko backend stores application state in in-memory Map structures (profiles, glossary, learning, articles, papers, feedback, stocks, blogs) with incrementing ID counters for some entities.",
    "Role-based access control is enforced server-side; admin bootstrap uses an environment token compared with a caller-provided secret on first initialization.",
    "Maintenance mode is enforced in Motoko via a shared checkMaintenanceAccess guard; frontend has a MaintenanceWrapper that swaps the entire app to a MaintenanceScreen for non-admins.",
    "Chat assistant does client-side intent detection (recommendation/legal-tax/calculator) to refuse early; otherwise it calls a backend chatAsk API and renders typed sources with deep links.",
    "Blob-storage capabilities are integrated via a Motoko mixin that manages authorized gateway principals, dead-blob pruning, GC triggering, and cycle top-up via a cashier canister.",
    "Backend includes reusable HTTP outcall wrappers (GET/POST + response transform) for future internet-connected features."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Motoko chatAsk ignores the user’s question and returns all glossary/learning/article sources, producing large payloads and low-quality relevance.",
    "“Use Web Sources” toggle exists in the chat widget UI but is disabled; backend does not yet return internetResult sources from real outcalls.",
    "Backend getMarketStatus() and isMarketOpen() are stubbed to always return false; frontend relies on client-side IST market-hours logic for “Live/Closed” labeling.",
    "Backend does not fetch live NIFTY 50 prices; stock data must be populated/updated via admin calls, so the ticker may be empty or stale.",
    "submitFeedback on the backend requires the caller to have the #user role; ContactPage does not enforce login, so unauthenticated users will fail to submit feedback.",
    "Blog timestamps are likely incorrect: addBlog/updateBlog set lastUpdatedAt to publishedAt (not current time), and updateBlogUpdatedTime uses a forced timestamp rather than Time.now().",
    "Blogs list ordering is unspecified (Map iteration order); UI may show posts in non-chronological order unless sorted client-side or server-side.",
    "Several calculators use simplified assumptions (e.g., FD assumes quarterly compounding; RD uses a simplified accumulation approach; APY uses an approximate matrix), so results may differ from official/bank-specific rules.",
    "XIRR uses a basic Newton–Raphson approximation without robust handling for derivative≈0/non-convergence; some cashflow patterns may yield unstable results.",
    "Admin page direct path '/admin' on icp0 can fail with gateway 'couldn't determine the destination canister' error; app may require hash-based routing (e.g., '#/admin') or proper canister-aware routing configuration."
